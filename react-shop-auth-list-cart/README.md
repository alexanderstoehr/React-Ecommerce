# React Onlineshop
The React Onlineshop project is a web application designed to simulate an online shopping experience. Built using React, Redux, and React Router, it showcases a dynamic product listing fetched from a JSON file, enabling users to browse items in a grid layout. Key features include user authentication through JWT for login and registration, adding products to a shopping cart, adjusting quantities, and removing items. The application emphasizes a user-friendly interface, ensuring responsiveness across mobile devices. Deployed on Netlify, it offers a practical demonstration of React's capabilities in creating scalable and interactive e-commerce platforms. A live demo is available for users to explore its functionalities.
